# Fake News (GPT)

## Purpose
Messing around. This is not to be taken seriously, and was not built to be extensible or maintainable. I just wanted to experiment with OpenAI's chat completion and DALL-E API. Seriously, this is not made to be pretty or use best practices.

## Tech
- [OpenAI's GPT-3 API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/)
- [OpenAI's DALL-E API](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` (for dev application)
4. If running non-locally: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying
